This is a plugin for Spark that allows users to join audio and video conferences hosted by [Pade Meetings](https://github.com/igniterealtime/openfire-pade-plugin/releases). 
See the documentation for more details. It provides a button from a Multi User Chat (MUC) room or chat window within the Spark client, to open a Chrome window using the URL for the Jitsi Meet web client. 
It uses Electron instead of depending on Chrome installed and configured as the default browser.

It is a much better user experience than opening a Chrome browser window out of context somewhere else. 
Screen sharing is not yet working. All Electron runtime platforms (windows, Linux & OSX) are supported. I have only tested it at home on my windows desktop. 
Feeback will be appreciated from Linux and OSX users.
